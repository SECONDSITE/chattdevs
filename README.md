## Installation and Technical

The app is currently running on Ruby 2.0 and Rails 4.  Installation is straight forward

    $ bundle install
    $ rake db:populate
    $ rails s
    
You should now have a running rails server with a seeded database.

### Omniauth

We use omniauth to allow people to sign in through github.
